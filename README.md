# Microcontrollers - Assembly course

## Code from my learning of Assembly language for [ATmega128A](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega128A) dev boards.

### Tasklist explained
During my course I was provided with tasks to solve. Below I summarized them.
* **tasks 1 to 3** - very simple Assembly data manipulation, no files provided
* **task 4** - search for odd numbers in program memory array and place them in data memory array
* **task 5** - get values from array and modify them based on their binary sequence (if higher/lower nibble is "x" or "y")
* **task 6** - read ports B status (buttons/input) and display it in port C (LEDs/output)
* **task 7**- set each bit of port B (input) to specific button and display it status in specific bit in port C (output)
* **task 8**- if some defined buttons in input port B (lower/higher nibble) are pushed react accordingly and show a message in output port C
* **task 9**- check which specific button (from 1 to 8) is pressed and display the binary representation of that number in LEDs
* **task 10**- convert decimal number to BCD
* **task 11**- prepare subroutine for assesement of pressure (represented by array), traverse the array with buttons and display LED message to each pressure
* **task 12**- create bubble sort algorythm
* **task 13**- create array of lenght = 15, with buttons user will pick the n-th element and subroutine should show it with LEDs
* **task 14**- implement "bouncing button" precaution subroutine

### Plans for the future?
I really liked solving tasks with Assembly. I think I will continue to learn it with more interesting challenges. Those files will be added here then.
